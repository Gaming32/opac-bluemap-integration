# OPaC BlueMap

This mod will show land claims from the [Open Parties and Claims](https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims) mod in the maps from the [BlueMap](https://modrinth.com/mod/bluemap) mod. This has currently only been tested on 1.19.2, but may work on newer versions.

## Usage

Simply install both the Open Parties and Claims mod as well as the BlueMap mod (and this mod), and you should be all set!
